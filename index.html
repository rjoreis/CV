  <h1>Ricardo Reis</h1>
  <p><em><strong>Master's Degree</strong> student in Computer and Multimedia Engineering.</em></p>
  <p>Loves to <strong>program</strong> and to learn new features.</p>
  <p>Since I was a little child I enjoyed learning new technology stuff. When I got my first computer I didn't quite want to leave the chair's seat.
    I am quite addicted to being in front of a computer, either programming, learning new things to do or playing video games.
    I am also a coffee addict.</p>
